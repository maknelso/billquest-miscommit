"""
Integration tests for protected API endpoints.

This module contains integration tests that verify the protected API endpoints
require proper authentication and authorization. These tests make actual HTTP requests
to the deployed APIs with and without authentication tokens.

Tests are skipped unless the ENVIRONMENT variable is set to "test" to prevent
accidental execution against production endpoints.
